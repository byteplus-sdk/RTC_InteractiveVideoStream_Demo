## BytePlus RTC

[BytePlus RTC](https://www.byteplus.com/en/product/rtc) provides high-quality, low-latency real-time audio and video communication capabilities across the global Internet. We can also help developers quickly build many functions including voice call, video call, interactive live streaming, and push to CDN by calling BytePlus RTC API.

## **Use Case**

Use cases provide best-practices for interactive entertainment. The Demo provides open-source client-side codes and supporting documentation to help developers develop applications quickly.

## **Description**

Interactive video streaming is a common scenario in pan-entertainment. After the host starts a live stream, he/she can battle with other hosts across rooms, or invite the audiences in his/her room to join the live. During live, adding beauty effects and playing background music are supported. In this use case, audiences subscribe to RTC streams directly, which reduces the delay of watching live and improves audience's experience of switching roles between audience and guest.
