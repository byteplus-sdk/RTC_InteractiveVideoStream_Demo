## **BytePlus RTC Solution Demo**

Solution Demo provides best-practices for interactive entertainment. The Demo provides open-source server-side and client-side codes and supporting documentation to help developers develop use cases quickly.

## **Description**

Interactive video streaming is a common scenario in pan-entertainment. After the host starts a live stream, he/she can battle with other hosts across rooms, or invite the audiences in his/her room to join the live. During live, adding beauty effects and playing background music are supported. In this scenario, audiences subscribe RTC streams directly, which reduces the delay of watching live and improves audience's experience of switching roles between audience and guest.
